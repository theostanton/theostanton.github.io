    <h3>Head of Product - <a href="http://dojoapp.co">Dojo</a></h3>
    <h5>March 2016 - September 2016</h5>
    <h6>After starting off as an Android developer I was promoted to lead the development team. Managing the iOS,
        Android, Web, Backend, Analytics and Internal Website development.
        My priority was to introduce a structured work methodology into the team, so as the team could double in size,
        increase the technological complexity, the work efficiency and be brought into its next generation.
        <br><br>
        <b>Management</b> - Introduced daily stand-ups, fortnightly retrospectives, fortnightly one-to-ones,
        knowledge sharing + pairing, application championing, git discipline, strict coding standards, microservice
        paradigms, feature roadmap paradigms, testing, testing, testing, structuring team-member onboarding and a
        glorious 9 month Gantt chart. The team became solid, excelling both technically and culturally.
        <br><br>
        <b>Culture</b> - Culture is paramount. For my two years at Dojo I looked forward to each and every day, not once
        glancing at the clock. It was essential that this transpired to the rest of the development team. Transparency
        and candour are important to me, leaving nothing unsaid. Everybody contributes, everbody's opinion is valued and
        so everybody knows they are performing at their utmost, learning along the way. If you're working with me you
        will enjoy it.
        <br><br>
        <b>Design</b> - When using any app is it possible to decipher the quality of communication between the tech and
        design team. Leading the tech and design teams I made sure that communication was seamless, enabling qualities
        from both realms to shine through. This communication is to come from the team members too, in developer roles I
        am sure to communicate clearly to the design team so as they are always aware of what is possible.
        <br><br>
        <b>Analytics</b> - On becoming Head of Product a major feature I designed and pushed was an improved analytics
        system. Creating an in-house analytics data warehouse that fed live recommendations and suggestions to users, as
        well as bringing the best possibly stats to the content team, design team and business owners.
        I hired 2 specialist backend developers and a skilled data scientist specifically for the purpose. The project
        was complex and involved each member of the development team. The success of the project came down to smart
        design and architecture, consulting the relevant team members, concise documentation and careful structuring and
        planning of the teams workloads and dependencies. Unfortunately I finished at Dojo before it came to production,
        I took away a great deal of knowledge along the journey.
        <br><br>
        <b>Google + Apple</b> - Meetings with the Play Store team at Google and the App Store team at Apple were common.
        Conferences at both thef
        Google and Apple campuses to keep on top of what the platforms have to offer.
        <br><br>
        <b>AWS</b> - Whilst leading the team I developed a great understanding of AWS ecosystems, tying our EC2 + Lambda
        microservices together. Monitoring and logging was made possible via NewRelic, in house slackbots and
        Dockerising our applications.
        <br><br>
        <b>Dojo</b> - Dojo is a lifestyle app for helping millenials find stuff do to in their cities. Currently based
        in London and
        Paris it has 750k downloads on Android and iOS.
        <br><br>
        My time at Dojo was a fantastic experience. Evolving as a programmer, I became a generalist developer with
        experience in full stack, analytics and design. Understanding the production cycle I know have refined foresight
        at all stages of the process. Learning to lead a development team, getting the best out of each team member
        ensuring everyone goes home satisfied with their day, proud of their work and enjoyed themselves. Amongst these
        explicit skills above and other experience based skills, common sense prevailed in this role readin and adapting
        to evolving situations, working in an agile methodology, so as each member of the team harnesses their talents.

    <h3>Android Developer - <a href="http://dojoapp.co">Dojo</a></h3>
    <h5>January 2015 - March 2016</h5>
    <h6>
        Since day 1 I have been the sole Android developer at Dojo. It can be found <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.dojoapp.dojo">here</a>.
        Boasting over 100k downloads, a rating of 4.5, #4 Best app of 2015 according to Google Play Store and featured
        countless times. It uses Androids latest technologies to remain smooth and
        sleak. Feature parity between iOS and Android was maintained whilst implementing some Android specific quirks to
        keep it feeling like an Android app.
        <br><br>
        <b>RxJava</b> - RxJava introduces functional reactive programming to Android. Means I never have to mutter the
        words A-Sync-Task ever again.
        <br><br>
        <b>Kotlin</b> - After introducing Kotlin to the Android source code last Autumn. Is a beautiful language that
        removes some of Javas nuissances and introduces some modern language features.
        My favourite features would be inline functions, null-safety handling, smart casting, string templates,
        singleton handling, extensions functions. To namy a few.
        Coding in Java isn't an issue, I just had the privilege at Dojo of being able to implement an interoperable
        language into the source and too advantage of that.
        <br><br>
        <b>MVP</b> - MVP architecture throughout the app using the Mosby library ensures the codebase is maintainable,
        clean and testable.
        <br><br>
        <b>Material design</b> - Kept in close talks with the Play Store team to make sure the app was satisfying their
        requests and working closely with the CTO and UI/UX
        team, we made sure the app followed material design guidelines. Helping the user feel accustomed to the app the
        moment they start using it. Never settling until we hit 60 fps.
        <br><br>
        <b>99.9% crash free</b> - Cause that's how it should be.

    <h3>Electronic Engineer - Freelance</h3>
    <h5>June 2013 - Present</h5>
    <h6>Working on a dozen different projects. A few of which can be seen on the <a
            href="http://theostanton.com/#projects">Projects page</a>.
        <br><br>
        Immediately after graduating I began hunting out the most stimulating freelance projects to work on. Some
        spanning 2-3 months and comprised of art installations, musical instruments and prototype projects. The projects
        came through vigorous networking and communication, working for individuals as well as established companies.
        <br><br>
        For the 18 month period I ensured each project was based around my current favourite language or
        technology, working and studying 24/7 to soak up all the programming and engineering skills I could.
        This gave me practical knowledge of core languages like C++, Java, Python and eventually the Android framework.
        As well as pushing my hardware electronics skills to the next level, with many of the projects based around
        Arduinos, RaspberryPis and hardware electronics.
