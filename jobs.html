    <h6>After starting off as an Android developer I went on to lead the development team.
        My priority was to introduce a structured work methodology into the team, so as the team could double in size,
        increase the technological complexity, the work efficiency and be brought into its next generation.
        <br><br>
        To name a few, this included daily stand-ups, fortnightly retrospectives, fortnightly one-to-ones,
        knowledge sharing + pairing, application championing, git discipline, strict coding standards, microservice
        paradigms, feature roadmap
        paradigms, testing, testing, testing, structuring team-member onboarding and a detailed tech roadmap of 9
        months.
        <br><br>
        An analytics heavy system was to come to fruition. Giving users live suggestions based on the users habits and
        like-users tastes. By means of injecting content within the users app session and via push notifications based
        on time of day and user location.
        The complex infrastructure meant a well documented and understood architecture was vital. Consulting team
        members individually and as a group to make sure we knew we were making the best deciisoons possible and
        iterating quickly to changes in design without hindrance to the overall project. The team became solid,
        excelling both technically and culturally.
        <br><br>
        Bringing the best out of the designers by opening up the communication amongst the development team so as the
        features had the best possible tech considerations early on in the design process.
        <br><br>
        Whilst leading the team I developed a great understanding of AWS ecosystems, tying our EC2 + Lambda
        microservices together. Monitoring and logging was made possible via NewRelic, in house slackbots and
        Dockerising our applications.
        <br><br>
