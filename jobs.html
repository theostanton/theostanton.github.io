    <h3>Head of Product - <a href="http://dojoapp.co">Dojo</a></h3>
    <h5>March 2016 - September 2016</h5>
    <h6>After starting off as an Android developer I went on to lead the development team.
        My priority was to introduce a structured work methodology into the team, so as the team could double in size,
        increase the technological complexity, the work efficiency and be brought into its next generation.
        <br><br>
        <b>Management</b> - Introduced daily stand-ups, fortnightly retrospectives, fortnightly one-to-ones,
        knowledge sharing + pairing, application championing, git discipline, strict coding standards, microservice
        paradigms, feature roadmap paradigms, testing, testing, testing, structuring team-member onboarding and a
        glorious 9 month Gantt chart. The team became solid, excelling both technically and culturally.
        <br><br>
        <b>Analytics</b> - An in-house analytics heavy system was to come to fruition. Giving users live suggestions based on the users habits and
        like-users tastes. By means of injecting content within the users app session and via push notifications based
        on time of day and user location.
        The complex infrastructure meant a well documented and defined architecture was vital. Consulting team
        members individually and as a group to make sure we knew we were making the best decisions possible and
        iterating quickly to changes in design without hindrance to the overall project.
        <br><br>
        <b>Design</b> - Bringing the best out of the designers by opening up the communication amongst the development team so as the
        features had the best possible tech considerations early on in the design process.
        <br><br>
        <b>Google + Apple</b> - Meetings with the Play Store team at Google and the App Store team at Apple were common. Conferences at both the
        Google and Apple campuses to keep on top of what the platforms have to offer.
        <br><br>
        <b>AWS</b> - Whilst leading the team I developed a great understanding of AWS ecosystems, tying our EC2 + Lambda
        microservices together. Monitoring and logging was made possible via NewRelic, in house slackbots and
        Dockerising our applications.
        <br><br>
        <b>Dojo</b> - Dojo is a lifestyle app for helping millenials find stuff do to in their cities. Currently based in London and
        Paris it has 750k downloads on Android and iOS.

    <h3>Android Developer - <a href="http://dojoapp.co">Dojo</a></h3>
    <h5>January 2015 - March 2016</h5>
    <h6>
        Since day 1 I have been the sole Android developer at Dojo. It can be found <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.dojoapp.dojo">here</a>.
        Boasting over 100k downloads and a rating of 4.5 it uses Androids latest technologies to remain smooth and
        sleak. Feature parity between iOS and Android was maintained whilst implementing some Android specific quirks to
        keep it feeling like an Android app.
        <br><br>
        <b>RxJava</b> - RxJava introduces functional reactive programming to Android. Means I never have to mutter the
        words A-Sync-Task ever again.
        <br><br>
        <b>Kotlin</b> - After introducing Kotlin to the Android source code last Autumn. Is a beautiful language that
        removes some of Javas nuissances and introduces some modern language features.
        My favourite features would be inline functions, null-safety handling, smart casting, string templates,
        singleton handling, extensions functions. To namy a few.
        Coding in Java isn't an issue, I just had the privilege at Dojo of being able to implement an interoperable
        language into the source and too advantage of that.
        <br><br>
        <b>MVP</b> - MVP architecture throughout the app using the Mosby library ensures the codebase is maintainable,
        clean and testable.
        <br><br>
        <b>Material design</b> - Kept in close talks with the Play Store team to make sure the app was satisfying their
        requests and feeling like a native Android app. Helping the user feel acustomed to the pap the moment they start
        using it.
        <br><br>
        <b>99.9% crash free</b> - Cause that's how it should be.

    <h3>Electronic Engineer - Freelance</h3>
    <h5>June 2013 - Present</h5>
    <h6>Working on an array of different projects. A few of which can be seen on the <a href="/#projects">Projects page</a>.
        <br><br>
        After graduating I immediately went to finding interesting Freelance projects to work on. Most spanned 2-3
        months each and comprised of art installations, musical instruments and prototype projects.
        <br><br>For the 18 month period I ensured each project was based around my current favourite language or
        technology, working and studying 24/7 to soak up all the programming and engineering skills I could.
        This gave me practical knowledge of core languages like C++, Java, Python and eventually the Android framework.
        As well as pushing my hardware electronics skills to the next level, with many of the projects based around
        Arduinos and RaspberryPis and hardware electronics.
