    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <h5>Fluent</h5>
    <h6><b>Kotlin</b> - Transitioned to Android development written in Kotlin last Autumn and haven't looked back. Can
        still write in Java naturally.
        <br><b>Java</b> - Studied before Android development. Big fan of Effective Java by Joshua Bloch.
        <br><b>Python</b> - Because it`s real nice to code with. Used on an array of projects, particularly data based
        tasks. Also love using Zappa to spin up a quick Lambda.
    </h6>
    <h5>Working proficiency</h5>
    <h6><b>Javascript</b> - Not my language of choice but a necessary evil.
        Particularly from my time at Dojo, couldn't ignore that most of stack was JS. Mainly for node.js.
        <br><b>C++</b> - Used at University and on all Arduino projects.
        <br><b>AWS ecosystems</b> - EC2s, Redshift, S3 buckets, Lambdas, RDS and just a taster of ElastiSearch.

    <h5>Fluent</h5>
    <h6><b>Arduino</b> - Still love Arduinos. Only for my own projects nowadays.

        Prospective project is a solar panneled, gravity pumped, multi output irrigation system with webcam progress
        tracking, Slack notifications and website monitoring system, to be implemented with my housemate.
        Have to get the flowerbed first though.
    <br><b>Raspberry Pi / Cubieboard</b> -
    <br><b>Components / Circuitry</b> - Passive or Active, Actuator or Sensor, I studied them at University and put them to good use during my time freelancing.</h6>
