        <h3>Cycling</h3>
        <h6>During my university summer breaks I went on two cycle trips.
            <br><br>
            The first I cycled from Barcelona, all over the Pyrenees, up the west coast of France to Bristol and
            finally to Brighton.
            Covering 1500 miles in 10 days. Raising Â£1500 for charity.
            <br><br>
            The second was a gentler tour around the UK over 3 months with a friend.
            Going to 7 music festivals, we ventured around the Peak District, cycled the Isle of Man TT, around
            Snowdonia and the beautiful Brecon Beacons.
            Wild camping all the way in some of the most beautiful locations.</h6>

        <h3>Cities</h3>
        <h6>Lapping up all the people, places and things that London has to offer. From theatres and gigs, to pointless
            pop-ups and beers with friends.
            <br><br>
            My love for cities doesn't stop at London. Weekend trips to different cities around the world, Oslo
            and New York are recent favourites.

        <h3>Outdoors</h3>
        <h6>I lived in the Alps as a teenager for 6 years, spending all my free time snowboarding, climbing, swimming, sailing,
            hiking, paragliding, mountainbiking... For those 6 years I went to French schools and learnt to speak French fluently.</h6>
