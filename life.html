    <h3>Cycling</h3>
    <h6>During my university summer breaks I went on two cycle trips.</h6>
    <h6>The first I cycled from Barcelona, all over the Pyrees to Bristol and finally to Brighton.
        Covering 1500 miles in 10 days. Raising Â£1500 for charity.</h6>
    <h6>The second was a gentler tour around the UK over 3 months with a friend.
        Going to 7 music festivals, we ventured around the Peak District, cycled the Isle of Man TT, around Snowdonia
        and the Brecon Beacons.
        Wild camping all the way.</h6>
    <h3>London</h3>
    <h6>Lapping up all the people, places and things that London has to offer. From theatres and gigs, to pointless
        pop-ups and naked tea-parties.</h6>
    <h3>Nature</h3>
    <h6>Brought up on a mountain. Snowboarding, climbing, swimming, sailing, paragliding, mountainbiking...
        All seem a world away from London but they're never too far.</h6>
    <h3>Travel</h3>
    <h6>Weekend get aways are the one. Favourites this year: New York and Oslo. Albania next. </h6>
