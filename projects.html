    <h6>Collaborating with Richard Hards on a number of installations at RCA, Barbican, Beaconsfields and others I took
        care of all the technical design and concepts to get the most out of his ideas.
        <br><br>
        Multiple sound/sculpture installations each consisting of around 80 motors controlled
        from a standalone Python app that launches all sorts of patterns to each of the individiually controlled motors.
        Each motor hits against part of the environment, be it a window or metal beam, to create a huge audio scape.
        <br><br>
        Below is a teaser of the soundscape, it's very much a 3D audiotory experience in real life. More can be seen at

    <h3 id="tabla_content">eTabla</h3>
    <h6>Commisioned by Kuljit Bhamra and funded by Exeter University, this prototype is a fully functioning proof of
        concept of an Electronic Tabla instrument; to be used to help teach students the Tabla without the investment
        and maintenance of an authentic instrument. The team consisted of Kuljit, a product designer who created the
        casing and myself accounting for all the technical aspects.
        <br><br>
        Kuljit recorded samples for each note, pitch and timbre possible. An array of different force sensitive
        resistors trigger recorded the samples. The envelope of sound is then tweaked by a combination of factors from
        pressures on sensors at moment of impact and whilst resonating. As true to an authentic Tabla as possible.
        <br><br>
        A fantastic project to work on, the technical challenges were rife and brilliant. A zero latency system was
        vital and we got there. The logic of the sensors readings onto the sound output to emulate an authentic Tabla
        required great back and forther between Kuljit and I, as well as me understanding the mechanics of a Tabla.

        native app and so I contacted the owner of the site and asked to make it for them. It is early stages and has
        been put on hold as the Mozilla Persona user authentication is about to become deprecated and hence replaced.
        Once that's sorted I shall be back on the case of getting this out for London cyclists to use.

    <h6>Full stack development of a platform to add comments to your Spotify playlists to share with others.
        <br><br>
        This is a play project of mine that is mainly for use amongst me and my friends. The user will login to the
        platform with Spotify and be able to add comments to their playlists and tracks within. They can then share
        these commented playlists for their friends to see. Starting at just user playlists and comments, the relational
        database schema is in such a way that any Spotify playlist, track or artist can have comments from any user and
        open for anyone to see.
        <br><br>
        It is a great way for me to develop the full stack in one project. A backend in Node.js, Postgres database,
        running on Heroku
        rather than AWS. The API is providing data for the website and is prepped for use with Android and iOS clients
        once I come round to it.

    <h6>A device to be worn on a user that tracks their activity and movements. Deciphering whether a user is sitting,
        standing or walking and encouraging them to have a little walkabout if they've been stationary too long.
        <br><br>
        This was a proof of concept functioning device and Android app to go to investors with. I accounted for the
        Android app and electronics hardware. Back in the early days of Bluetooth Low Energy beacons we made use of
        their tiny size, massive battery life and sensors. Device side code written in C++ tracked the relevant
        accelerometer and gyroscope readings, only computing when absolutely necessary to keep battery usage to a
        minimum and then pinging to the Android device at as greater intervals as possible. Tweaking these calculations
        the battery lasted weeks between charges and could decipher what the user was doing, updating the UI app side.

    <h3 id="quadmonitor_content">QuadMonitor</h3>
    <h6>My first Android project, a client for the QuadCopter communication protocol I created for use with my
        QuadCopter. It proved very useful on the field to tweak the QuadCopter coefficient values.
        <br><br>
        I never dared use the in app remote controls and stuck to my real transmitter. In theory the remote controls
        worked too!
        <br><br>
        All the graphs and sliders are custom canvases. Even the text is printed to canvas so as I had total freedom
        over the look and feel. In reality it was my first app and I could have likely found a graphing library that
        would have handled all the data interpretation and drawing for me. But was a great way to get stuck in.

        monitor the data flow within the app and tweak the coefficients and refresh rates for different elements of the
        computation. It proved an invaluable tool for tweaking the QuadCopter firmware. It was also a fantastic way to
        explain how the QuadCopter algorithms work to keep it afloat.

    <h3 id="quadcopter_content">QuadCopter</h3>
    <h6>For my final year project on my Electronic Engineering degree I chose to design and build a QuadCopter from
        scratch. Running on an Arduino microprocessor, a custom circuit and a handbuilt aluminium frame. Writing the
        firmware in C++ was an amazing experience and my first delve into applied programming.
        <br><br>
        Part of the project involved justifying all of my engineering decisions, including a full Simulink 3D model of
        the QuadCopter that would calculate the PID feedback coefficients to be used on the real model.
        <br><br>
        The QuadCopter flew very well and I continued to develop it after University. It's the ultimate toy to build
        from scratch and contains a ton of different technical challengees.
